Architecture:
Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
- The frontend development required for the Single Page Application as a lot more involved and needed multiple components working together in order to produce a page an admin could have access to with the right credentials.
  
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
- Initially the projec tused information fed from a JSON file. It was switched to a NoSQL MongoDB database to aloow for information to be more scalable.


Functionality:
How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
- JSON is a file type meant to store information, not a language. The backend sends data as a JSON file to the frontend which is able to parse the informaiton within it and display the content.
  
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
- A brief example of this being implemented are the <router-outlet></router-outlet> tags which load different components.

Testing:
Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
- The main method of testing endpoints was through the use of Postman. Some endpoints were api/login and api/register.

Reflection:
How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
- While I feel I still have a lot to learn about full stack development especially considering the field is ever-evolving, I do feel more confident having a new skill from the field than not.
